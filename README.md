# :poultry_leg: Right Now K bbq :meat_on_bone:
> find Korean BBQ restaurants open now around you!

This web app uses web geolocation api to track and show a list of Korean BBQ restaurants nearby. If you feel hungry, then try it out right now! Turn on your locaiton service, then you are good to go. I built this app for myself. My friends and I always have a hard & long time to decide where to go. Since we all crave for Korean BBQ, so we needed a simple list of restaurants that is opening right now and must be nearby. I think this web app can solve our problem. 

(I guess I'm so lazy to filter out all the categories on Yelp. :laughing:)
